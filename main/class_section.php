                            Perfect for everybody and every body! Each Zumba® class is designed to bring people together to sweat it on. We take the "work" out of workout, by mixing low-intensity and high-intensity moves for an interval-style, calorie-burning dance fitness party. Once the Latin and World rhythms take over, you'll see why Zumba® fitness classes are often called exercise in disguise. A total workout, combining all elements of fitness – cardio, muscle conditioning, balance and flexibility, boosted energy and a serious dose of awesome each time you leave class.

                            The first half of the class combines guided visualization, mindfulness, loving-kindness, imagery, reflective inquiry, storytelling, and breathing techniques. You'll experience the CABCs: Check-in with yourself, Align the body, Breathe, and Check-in again. This approach allows you to tune into your inner world and define your own self-soothing techniques. In the second half of the class, you'll transition into a soothing body scan, gentle, restorative stretching and joint mobilization and conclude with a gentle relaxation.

                            Distinctive style, moves and music. Cardio Dance draws from a plethora of dance styles integrating new combinations of cardiovascular aerobics while toning. There’s stretching (standing & floor) and some abdominal core work as well to top things off. If you enjoy dancing or would like more fluidity and coordination, this class can kick in your groove.
